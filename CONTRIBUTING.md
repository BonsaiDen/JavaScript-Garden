# Contributing to Javascript Garden

1. We're about Javascript AKA [ECMA script](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/) not a specific implementation. So we don't cover issues specific to one environment or interpreter, like browsers or V8 for node.
1. Micro-performance is out of scope: anything that's not a result of essential algorithmic complexity (e.g O(log n) vs O(n^2)) is down to a specific version of a specific interpreter (see 1).
1. Please test code examples to ensure they work, there's nothing more confusing than incorrect examples!
1. Contributing to JS Garden makes you a fantastic person, and Brendan Eich will find you immensely attractive.
