JavaScript Garden
=================

**JavaScript Garden** is a growing collection of documentation about the most 
quirky parts of the JavaScript programming language. It gives advice to 
avoid common mistakes, subtle bugs, as well as performance issues and bad 
practices that non-expert JavaScript programmers may encounter on their 
endeavours into the depths of the language.

JavaScript Garden does **not** aim to teach you JavaScript. Former knowledge
of the language is strongly recommended in order to understand the topics covered
in this guide. In order to learn the basics of the language, please head over to 
the excellent [guide][1] on the Mozilla Developer Network.

### The authors

This guide is the work of two lovely Stack Overflow users, [Ivo Wetzel][6]
(Original English Language Version) and [Zhang Yi Jiang][5] (Design), and
[many others](https://github.com/BonsaiDen/JavaScript-Garden/graphs/contributors)
who've worked hard to provide translations or fixes.

It's currently maintained by [Tim Ruffles](http://twitter.com/timruffles).

## Contributing
